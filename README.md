# jestermaxx ai

your text has a recessed mandible and prey eyes. we fix that.

jestermaxx ai translates your mid normie copy into chronically online looksmax speak — or generates it from scratch. every sentence gets mogged into ascension. the forward growth on the output is genuinely elite.

## how it works

1. pick your mode: **jestermaxx [my copy]** or **jestermaxx [my idea]**
2. paste your text or describe what you need written
3. get brutalmogged by the output

that's it. zero bloat. compact midface architecture on the UX. just submit bro.

## stack

- **next.js** — framemogging every other react framework
- **ai sdk** — streaming with hunter eyes precision
- **tailwind + shadcn** — softmaxxed UI, clean gonial angle on every component
- **geist mono** — the only font with positive canthal tilt

## run locally

```bash
git clone <repo>
cd jestermaxx
npm install
```

add a `.env.local`:

```
DEFAULT_MODEL=your-model-here
```

```bash
npm run dev
```

open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). ascension begins.

## prompts

system prompts live in `lib/translate.md` and `lib/generate.md`. edit them directly — changes take effect on restart. the vocabulary system is a generative grammar, not a word list. every suffix is productive. invent relentlessly.

## it's over for

- boring text
- normie copy
- mid captions
- bluepilled emails
- recessed DMs

mog or be mogged.
